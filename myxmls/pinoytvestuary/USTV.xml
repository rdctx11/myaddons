<info>The American Broadcasting Company (abbreviated ABC, stylized in the logo as abc since 1962) is an American commercial broadcast television network. Throughout its history, ABC has supported its financial operations by diversifying into the press, the publishing industry, the operation of theaters, and filmmaking. Many of the company's assets in these fields have been sold to other entities, and since 2007, when ABC Radio (also known as "Cumulus Media Networks") was sold to Citadel Broadcasting, ABC has reduced its broadcasting operations almost exclusively to television. It is the world's fifth-oldest major broadcasting media network.</info>
