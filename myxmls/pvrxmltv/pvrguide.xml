    <title lang="en">Letters to Juliet</title>
    <desc lang="en">This title is a romantic comedy that was directed by Gary Winick. The film stars Amanda Seyfried, Gael Garcia Bernal and Chris Egan among other talents and was released in theaters in North America on May 14th, 2010. Sophie Hall (Amanda Seyfried) has an unglamorous job working as a fact checker for “The New Yorker” magazine. Her fiancé, Victor (Gael Garcia Bernal), is about to open an Italian restaurant in New York. The couple agree to go on a trip to Italy as a sort of “pre-honeymoon” celebration. However upon arriving at Italy, and much to Sophie’s dismay, Victor seems to be more concerned with finding genuine Italian ingredients for use in his restaurant’s kitchen than he is with spending time with his fiancé. While wandering around town on her own, Sophie finds the house were Juliet Capulet is supposed to have lived in. As part of a local tradition, people gather at that spot to write letters to Juliet which they then post on the house’s walls. Sophie decides to stay after closing hours in order to see what happens to the letters. Thus, she learns that an old woman comes around to collect the letters that are intended for Juliet. She follows the woman and learns that she is one of “Juliet’s secretaries” who seem to have assigned themselves the job of replying to the letters posted to Juliet about amorous concerns. Sophie joins the women and soon discovers a letter that was written in 1957 by an Englishwoman named Claire. As often happens with love stories, Sophie’s life becomes intertwined with that of Claire as the two unexpectedly find themselves together in an adventure to find their true partners. Despite the fact that all they have to go on is a name, Sophie and Claire endeavor to find Claire’s long-lost lover. In the process, Sophie learns more about herself and what she wants than she had previously bargained for</desc>

    <desc lang="en">The tragedy of his brother’s suicide has destroyed the unity of Tyler’s family. His parents have separated and Tyler is now alienated from his father. In this bleak context, Tyler, the young rebellious New Yorker meets a beautiful girl who would bring happiness and harmony back into his life. Elle’s good-looks and “carpe diem” philosophy enchant Tyler and he falls in love with her. Gradually, Tyler feels that his life has meaning once more and she teaches him how to live life in earnest and with gratitude for all the tiny, lovely details that surround them. However, this air of serenity is short lived and ugly secrets that were long hidden start to resurface and to threaten the new relationship. These threats help Tyler learn that real love is a precious thing that deserves to be fought for at any price, even death. This picture is packed with joy and romance, not to mention its fair share of tribulation. It relates a love story that should serve as a reminder for all of us of the importance of living our lives with optimism, hope and faith in all that is good</desc>
