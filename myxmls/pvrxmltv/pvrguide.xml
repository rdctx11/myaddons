    <title lang="en">The Expendables</title>
    <desc lang="en">This title is an action film that features an ensemble cast which includes Sylvester Stallone, Jet Li, Jason Statham and Bruce Willis to name only a few. Since its release in mid-August, the film has received mixed reviews from critics but has nonetheless achieved a considerable measure of success at the box office. The Expendables are a group of elite mercenaries led by Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone). Like all other respectable fighting teams the Expendables is composed of a small set of specialists each of whom boasts a very specific set of talents. Thus, the team includes a blades specialist, a dedicated sniper and a martial artists among other weapons experts. The film opens with a scene set at the Gulf of Aden - not far off the coast of Somalia - where the Expendables have just succeeded in stopping a group of pirates from executing their hostages. Despite the success of their mission there nonetheless appears to be a measure of discord between the members of the team which soon takes the form of open hostility. The team’s leader, Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone), succeeds in resolving the dispute - at least for the time being. Soon afterwards, the Expendables are offered a much more challenging assignment. They are tasked with the overthrow of General Garza (David Zayas), a brutal dictator who rules the island of Vilena with an iron fist. Although the Expendables are arguably the best team for such a job, they soon learn that things aren’t always what they appear to be. As their newly assigned mission goes awry, the old fissures among the ranks of the Expendables come back into the picture. This time however, the consequences are much more dire. As the action-packed tour-de-force comes to its nail biting conclusion a curious twist of fate shows us that no matter how far someone has strayed from the path of good, it is never too late for redemption and reconciliation</desc>

    <title lang="en">Knowing</title>
    <desc lang="en">This title is a sci-fi disaster film directed by Alex Proyas. The production stars Nicolas Cage among others. In 1959, children at William Dawes Elementary School in Lexington, Massachusetts are encouraged to put drawings representing their predictions of the future in a school time capsule that is to be opened fifty years later. One particular girl, Lucinda Embry, stands out. Rather than contributing a drawing, she instead places in the capsule a page that is full of unknown numbers. Fifty years later, in 2009, the time capsule is opened and John Kestler’s son takes home the page of numbers that was placed in the capsule by Lucinda. John Kestler soon realizes that the numbers are not at all random but rather represent the date, location and casualty numbers of every major disaster since then. John’s suspicions are confirmed when the numbers correctly predict a series of disaster. Although the disasters predicted thus far had been limited in casualties, the numbers predict one more disaster that will end the human race as we know it. Can John learn enough about the disaster in order to stop it before it takes place? Moreover, if the disaster cannot be prevented, what will humanity’s fate be post the disaster</desc>
