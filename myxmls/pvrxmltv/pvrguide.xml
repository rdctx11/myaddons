    <desc lang="en">This title is a sci-fi disaster film directed by Alex Proyas. The production stars Nicolas Cage among others. In 1959, children at William Dawes Elementary School in Lexington, Massachusetts are encouraged to put drawings representing their predictions of the future in a school time capsule that is to be opened fifty years later. One particular girl, Lucinda Embry, stands out. Rather than contributing a drawing, she instead places in the capsule a page that is full of unknown numbers. Fifty years later, in 2009, the time capsule is opened and John Kestler’s son takes home the page of numbers that was placed in the capsule by Lucinda. John Kestler soon realizes that the numbers are not at all random but rather represent the date, location and casualty numbers of every major disaster since then. John’s suspicions are confirmed when the numbers correctly predict a series of disaster. Although the disasters predicted thus far had been limited in casualties, the numbers predict one more disaster that will end the human race as we know it. Can John learn enough about the disaster in order to stop it before it takes place? Moreover, if the disaster cannot be prevented, what will humanity’s fate be post the disaster</desc>
