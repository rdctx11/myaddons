    <title lang="en">District 9</title>
    <desc lang="en">This picture is a South African science fiction thriller that was directed by Neill Blomkamp. This unique film has garnered much critical acclaim and was nominated for four Academy Awards. Early in the 1980s an Alien ship came to a halt hovering over the South African city of Johannesburg. The aliens aboard the ship were relocated to District 9, a slum outside of Johannesburg. Wikus van de Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is a bureaucrat working for a large corporation. Wikus is tasked with overseeing the relocation of the extraterrestrials, derogatorily referred to as “Prawns” from District 9 to a newly constructed camp outside the city. Whilst overseeing the eviction of the aliens from their homes in District 9, Wikus comes into contact with a strange black chemical. Several hours after inhaling the chemical and to his horror, Wikus begins a physical transformation that makes him take the shape of the aliens. In the ensuing adventure the themes of xenophobia and apartheid are discussed in a very profound manner. Wikus learns that the “Prawns” as they are called are in fact misunderstood and that rather than being monsters they are actually gentle and loving creatures. Although the movie handles complicated themes it nonetheless has its fair share of action shots. All in all, it is a dramatic tour de force that teaches the viewer more than he would normally expect to learn from a sci-fi picture</desc>
