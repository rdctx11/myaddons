    <title lang="en">The Other Guys</title>
    <desc lang="en">This title is a an action-comedy crime picture that brings together two seemingly disparate talents: Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg. Dwayne Johnson, Michael Keaton and Samuel L. Jackson also assume roles as part of this production’s star studded cast. Detectives Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) and Terry Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) are the laughing stock of the police department. Gamble’s fumbling nature and Hoitz’s tendency to fire off his gun when it is least appropriate have guaranteed the pair desk jobs as long as there is any excuse to keep them off the street. However, when the department’s two leading detectives lose their lives in an unglamorous, nay, silly accident Gamble and Hoitz are given a chance to step up. Will Hoitz’s gung-ho nature and Gamble’s nerd-like demeanor somehow provide the magic recipe for forensic success? Or will the two manage to screw things up once again – thereby earning another several decades in the police department filing room</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Proposal</title>
    <desc lang="en">This production is a romantic comedy that was directed by Anne Fletcher. The film stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds. Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is the executive editor in chief of Ruick &amp; Hunt Publishing. Her iron-fist management style has made her very unpopular among her employees who resent her bossy ways. To her horror, Margaret learns that she is being deported to Canada as her visa has expired. In order to avert a forced deportation, Margaret forces her assistance Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds) to marry her. Although Andrew is a bit hesitant at first, he agrees after Margaret convinces him that if she is deported the new boss that would replace her will fire him straight away. The pair make their way to the Immigration Department where they meet immigration officer Mr. Gilbertson (Denis O’Hare). There they learn that a tip-off by one of Margaret’s former employees has led the department to suspect that their marital arrangements are fraudulent and are intended to avert Margaret’s deportation. They also learn that in order to verify the supposed marital process, the department will ask each of them questions separately in addition to interviewing their families. If they fail the interview process, Margaret will be deported and Andrew will be convicted of a felony with a $ 250,000 fine and a year in prison. Andrew has second thoughts about the arrangement after learning what it could cost him and thus he confronts Margaret and tells her he will continue the charade on the condition that she promotes him to editor and publishes his book. After seeing that he is adamant about his request, Margaret has no choice but to agree</desc>

    <desc lang="en">This picture is a remake of the 1984 martial arts classic of the same name. The film was directed by Harald Zwart and stars Jackie Chan, Jaden Smith and Taraji P. Henson. Dre Parker (Jaden Smith) is a young boy who has just moved to Beijing with his mother (Taraji P. Henson). Soon after settling in, Dre develops a crush on a young violinist. However, his attempts to get to know her are blocked by Cheng, a “kung fu kid” who has a good time beating Dre to the ground. At this point Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) comes to Dre’s aid and begins teaching him the kung fu skills he will need to turn back his adversaries</desc>
