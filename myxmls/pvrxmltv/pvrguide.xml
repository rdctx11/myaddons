    <title lang="en">The Expendables</title>
    <desc lang="en">This title is an action film that features an ensemble cast which includes Sylvester Stallone, Jet Li, Jason Statham and Bruce Willis to name only a few. Since its release in mid-August, the film has received mixed reviews from critics but has nonetheless achieved a considerable measure of success at the box office. The Expendables are a group of elite mercenaries led by Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone). Like all other respectable fighting teams the Expendables is composed of a small set of specialists each of whom boasts a very specific set of talents. Thus, the team includes a blades specialist, a dedicated sniper and a martial artists among other weapons experts. The film opens with a scene set at the Gulf of Aden - not far off the coast of Somalia - where the Expendables have just succeeded in stopping a group of pirates from executing their hostages. Despite the success of their mission there nonetheless appears to be a measure of discord between the members of the team which soon takes the form of open hostility. The team’s leader, Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone), succeeds in resolving the dispute - at least for the time being. Soon afterwards, the Expendables are offered a much more challenging assignment. They are tasked with the overthrow of General Garza (David Zayas), a brutal dictator who rules the island of Vilena with an iron fist. Although the Expendables are arguably the best team for such a job, they soon learn that things aren’t always what they appear to be. As their newly assigned mission goes awry, the old fissures among the ranks of the Expendables come back into the picture. This time however, the consequences are much more dire. As the action-packed tour-de-force comes to its nail biting conclusion a curious twist of fate shows us that no matter how far someone has strayed from the path of good, it is never too late for redemption and reconciliation</desc>

    <title lang="en">District 9</title>
    <desc lang="en">This picture is a South African science fiction thriller that was directed by Neill Blomkamp. This unique film has garnered much critical acclaim and was nominated for four Academy Awards. Early in the 1980s an Alien ship came to a halt hovering over the South African city of Johannesburg. The aliens aboard the ship were relocated to District 9, a slum outside of Johannesburg. Wikus van de Merwe (Sharlto Copley) is a bureaucrat working for a large corporation. Wikus is tasked with overseeing the relocation of the extraterrestrials, derogatorily referred to as “Prawns” from District 9 to a newly constructed camp outside the city. Whilst overseeing the eviction of the aliens from their homes in District 9, Wikus comes into contact with a strange black chemical. Several hours after inhaling the chemical and to his horror, Wikus begins a physical transformation that makes him take the shape of the aliens. In the ensuing adventure the themes of xenophobia and apartheid are discussed in a very profound manner. Wikus learns that the “Prawns” as they are called are in fact misunderstood and that rather than being monsters they are actually gentle and loving creatures. Although the movie handles complicated themes it nonetheless has its fair share of action shots. All in all, it is a dramatic tour de force that teaches the viewer more than he would normally expect to learn from a sci-fi picture</desc>
