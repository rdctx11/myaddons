    <title lang="en">Star Trek</title>
    <desc lang="en">This picture is a science fiction film directed by J. J. Abrams. It is a re-boot of the (Star Trek franchise) and features the main characters of the original Star Trek series, portrayed by a new cast. The picture has received much critical praise and was nominated for four Oscars – winning the Academy Award for Best Makeup, making it the first Star Trek film to win an Oscar. In the year 2233, Federation starship USS Kelvin is attacked by the Narada, a Romulan ship. The Kelvin’s captain is killed. Acting Captain George Kirk (Chris Hemsworth) orders the evacuation of the ship’s personnel, including his pregnant wife who is in labor. Moments before the Kelvin’s destruction, George and his wife decide to name their son Jim. The film then jumps several years to the story of young Spock. Spock is discriminated against by his peers on Vulcan for being half-human. After he matures, he opts to join Starfleet rather than the Vulcan Science Academy. Soon afterwards, the principal crew members of the original Star Trek series: James, Spock and Leonard McCoy, find themselves best situated to respond to a distress call from Vulcan. Thus, the inexperienced cadets find themselves launched head long into a confrontation with the Narada and its captain Nero who was responsible for killing James’ father several years prior</desc>

    <title lang="en">Star Trek</title>
    <desc lang="en">This picture is a science fiction film directed by J. J. Abrams. It is a re-boot of the (Star Trek franchise) and features the main characters of the original Star Trek series, portrayed by a new cast. The picture has received much critical praise and was nominated for four Oscars – winning the Academy Award for Best Makeup, making it the first Star Trek film to win an Oscar. In the year 2233, Federation starship USS Kelvin is attacked by the Narada, a Romulan ship. The Kelvin’s captain is killed. Acting Captain George Kirk (Chris Hemsworth) orders the evacuation of the ship’s personnel, including his pregnant wife who is in labor. Moments before the Kelvin’s destruction, George and his wife decide to name their son Jim. The film then jumps several years to the story of young Spock. Spock is discriminated against by his peers on Vulcan for being half-human. After he matures, he opts to join Starfleet rather than the Vulcan Science Academy. Soon afterwards, the principal crew members of the original Star Trek series: James, Spock and Leonard McCoy, find themselves best situated to respond to a distress call from Vulcan. Thus, the inexperienced cadets find themselves launched head long into a confrontation with the Narada and its captain Nero who was responsible for killing James’ father several years prior</desc>

    <title lang="en">The Social Network</title>
    <desc lang="en">This picture is a drama about the founding of the popular social network website “Facebook”. The film stars Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. David Fincher was the film’s director. Mark Zuckerberg is a Harvard student. After breaking up with his girlfriend, Mark has the idea to create a website where Harvard students can rate the attractiveness of females at the school. A friend helps him set up the site and it proves to be a big hit. Harvard authorities are not so impressed however when heavy traffic on the website disrupts part of Harvard’s network. He is punished with six months academic probation and also ends up making himself ridiculous in front of the female community. Soon afterwards Mark renews his efforts. The site launched by him and Eduardo this time round allows people to look up their friends without violating privacy. Thus, Marks new idea quickly takes hold and thenceforth it expands exponentially and Mark Zuckerberg’s brainchild becomes a massive hit. However, as the movie’s tag line goes: “You Don’t Get to 500 Million Friends without Making a Few Enemies”</desc>
