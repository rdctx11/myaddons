The picture has received much critical praise and was nominated for four Oscars – winning the Academy Award for Best Makeup, making it the first Star Trek film to win an Oscar. In the year 2233, Federation starship USS Kelvin is attacked by the Narada, a Romulan ship. The Kelvin’s captain is killed.

Soon afterwards, the principal crew members of the original Star Trek series: James, Spock and Leonard McCoy, find themselves best situated to respond to a distress call from Vulcan.
